## I. One Source
### A single source for all artifacts, each with versioning and traceability.

A modern firmware project has a number of assets which need to be easily found and tracked:
- Source Code
- Requirements
- Design Notes
- Meeting Notes
- Team Roster and Contact Information
- Team Communication Expectations
- Definition of Ready, Definition of Done

All developers on a modern embedded project have a single starting point to find all relevant assets. This often takes the form of a Wiki such as [Confluence] or [Notion], or also can be a README.md in the root of the source code respository with appropriate links.

Modern embedded projects prefer to put documentation in the most valuable format for the project. Sometimes this is a picture or a diagram, other times it is in a metaformat that can generate a picture or diagram. Word documents or other binary formats make it difficult to version and trace content within them. A markdown or text format is preferred as long as usability or readability is not lost.

Requirements are covered in more detail in another section, but it is critical that the team has a clear, accessible, searchable, and up-to-date reference of the product requirements. Misalignment on a team is one of the easiest ways for a project to be unsuccessful.
