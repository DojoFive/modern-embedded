*Able to observe and update the design and implementation during the entire product cycle.*

The best teams are able to observe and debug operation of their devices quickly and easily. The cost of fixing bugs is directly correlated to the stage of development within which they are discovered. The best teams discover the majority of their bugs quickly after they are introduced through automation and testing. They have invested in tools, reports, and dashboards that highlight the issue and allow resolution to proceed quickly and easily. For connected devices, this means observing the health of a fleet of devices and the ability to quickly assess and address any field issues that occur.

All devices must have an update machanism.
